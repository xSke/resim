## To do
- Expand to Discipline Era
- Expand to remainder of Expansion Era
- Investigate items
- Investigate weird EE mechanics
  - weird ballpark modifications
  - hype (derogatory)
- Clean up formulas in general

## In progress
- Runner advancement on flyouts (weird formula for 1st->2nd)
- Steal attempts formula (ARGH)
- Steal success formula
- Echo/feedback activation
- Figure out what's up with the modifiers that often throw us off
  - GROWTH: got a list of attributes it doesn't seem to apply to. could use more checking.
  - TRAVELING: got a list of attributes it doesn't seem to apply to. could use more checking.
  - ON_FIRE: tentatively correct, could use more checking
  - Night Vision Goggles: tentatively correct, could use more checking??
  - CHUNKY: tentatively correct, could use more checking
  - SMOOTH: tentatively correct, could use more checking
- work out what the hardcoded blooddrain exceptions are actually for (there's probably a simple pattern)
  - didn't Kidror figure out something, or am I misremembering?

## Done (for now) (ignoring weird modifiers)
- Strike zone formula
- Swing-in-zone formula
- Swing-out-of-zone formula (parabolas 😌)
- Hit vs out formula (it's kinda ugly tho)
- Flyout vs groundout formula
- Home run formula
- Triples formula
- Doubles formula
- Attractor star generation
- Foul ball formula
- "Sacrifice bunt" vs FC roll
- Bird message roll
- Contact-out-of-zone formula
- Figure out how to go "backwards in time" through the rng stream
- Contact-in-zone formula
- DP formula
- Sacrifice/Martyr formula
- Advancment formula (groundouts)
- Runner extra advancement on hits
- Haunted rates
- Consumer target selection
- consumer attack activation rates
- Figure out how Spicy/On Fire works (tentatively correct, need to check ground_friction)
- Fill out coverage for seasons we already have data for (missing S12D1-30, S13D24, S14D26&27, S15D4, S15D112&113, S17D1, S17D76, S17D79+, S18D1, S18D26, S18D51-57, S18D71, S18D72, S18D79, and a few minutes of S12D88)
