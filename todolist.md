## To do
- better error reporting for multiprocessing?
- Expand to Discipline Era

- Investigate items
- Investigate weird EE mechanics
  - weird ballpark modifications
  - hype (derogatory)

- Figure out what's up with the modifiers that often throw us off
  - GROWTH
  - TRAVELING
  - ON_FIRE
  - Night Vision Goggles
